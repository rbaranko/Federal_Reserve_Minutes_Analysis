# Federal_Reserve_Minutes_Analysis

Background: The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), a committee within the Federal Reserve System, is charged under United States law with overseeing the nation's open market operations. This Federal Reserve committee makes key decisions about interest rates and the growth of the United States money supply. Committee members meet regularly (typically once a month or once every other month) to make these decisions. Their meeting minutes are made public shortly after the meeting.

Goal: This project aims to (a) measure and quantify central bankers' positive and negative sentiment expressed during these high-level meetings, and then (b) examine how the two sentiment measures evolve over time on a yearly. Finally, we will examine what other factors contribute to negative (positive) market sentiment.
